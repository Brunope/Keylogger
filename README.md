Keylogger
=========
A Python keylogger that uses pyHook.

Dependencies
------------
* Python 2.7.3  
* py2exe  
* pyHook  
* win32api   
* pythoncom  
* pyHook  
* ImageGrab  

Usage
---------
Add an email to upload.py. Compile all the python files to executables using py2exe. I'll provide a single setup.py script to do this in an upcoming release. Add all the .exes to a flash drive, and create an autorun.inf file pointing to keylog_runner.exe. When the flash drive is plugged into a USB port, the computer becomes infected. When a clean USB storage device is then plugged into an infected computer, the storage device becomes infected.
